# FELO-System

This is, to my understanding, a Python based version of the FELO system currently in place but altered to make work in Google Sheets. Not sure what the plan is with that, just wanted to understand clearly what parts we are changing. Below I'll document my understanding of the project.

- The FELO system is an open source ELO rating system that will suddenly appear or be linked to if I delay googling it long enough
- Currently the FELO system uses notepad and a spreadsheet to generate the scores based off the formulas the system uses and displays them
- I was told, in rather uncertain terms, that what we want is to make the FELO system easier to enter and able to use Google Sheets to produce results. Not sure where python comes in that case, as it sounds like we just have to make a lot of hidden values and calculation in a spreadsheet, and have it display nice graphs and be able to add more competitiors easily.
- Feel free to correct or detail further what the objectives are.
